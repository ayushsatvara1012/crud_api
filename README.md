The backend server is now running. I have fixed the environment and dependency issues, and the `uvicorn` command is working as expected.

I have also created a `requirements.txt` file that lists all of the project's dependencies. To install the dependencies in a new environment, run the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
